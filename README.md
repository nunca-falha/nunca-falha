<h2> 👋 Hi, I’m <i> nunca-falha </i> </h2>
🏛️ I'm a final year student in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a major in Electronics and Computers.

The name nunca-falha originated from failing multiple times to create a username, so as a joke I tried to write nuncafalha / nunca-falha which translates to 'never fails', I ended up sticking with it.
